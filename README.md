# private-photo
An Android app to keep photos encrypted.

Uses a password to derive an encryption/decryption key. 

Designed to be able to have separate passwords for each photo.

Photos do not go anywhere outside the app and are saved encrypted with AES-256/CBS thus are not visible in the Gallery or any other app.

Essential minimum of permissions are required (only Camera at the moment).
